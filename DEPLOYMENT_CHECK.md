# Simple Deployment Check

This is a simplified testing setup focused on preventing linting errors before Vercel deployment.

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Check

Before deploying to Vercel, run:

```bash
npm run check-deployment
```

This will run:
- ✅ TypeScript type checking
- ✅ ESLint linting
- ✅ Build verification
- ✅ Basic tests

## 📋 Manual Checks

If you prefer to run checks individually:

```bash
# Check TypeScript types
npm run type-check

# Check code quality
npm run lint

# Test build
npm run build

# Run simple tests
npm run test:simple
```

## ✅ What This Prevents

- **TypeScript errors** that would break the build
- **ESLint errors** that would block deployment
- **Build failures** from missing dependencies
- **Import errors** from broken modules

## 🎯 Success Criteria

All checks must pass before deploying:
- No TypeScript errors
- No critical ESLint errors (warnings are OK)
- Build completes successfully
- Tests pass

## 🚨 If Checks Fail

1. Fix the errors shown in the output
2. Run the checks again
3. Only deploy when all checks pass

## 📝 Notes

- This is a simplified setup focused on preventing deployment failures
- Warnings are acceptable, but errors will block deployment
- The simple tests verify basic functionality without complex mocking
- Focus is on catching issues before they reach production
